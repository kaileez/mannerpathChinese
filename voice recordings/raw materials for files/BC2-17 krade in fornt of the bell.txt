The monster is going to molk between the snowmen
The monster is going to torg around the drum
The monster is going to pim up to the monkey
The monster is going to birk into the spaceship
The monster is going to dack up to the owl 
The monster is going to krade into the castle
The monster is going to glip down to the dog
The monster is going to zark up to the monkey
The monster is going to molk around the drum
The monster is going to torg between the snowmen
The monster is going to pim through the waterfall
The monster is going to birk over the mountain
The monster is going to dack in front of the bell
